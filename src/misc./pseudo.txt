//Functionality for character creation:
an empty initial state that will equal the values of all of the user inputs
(^ spread operator will be necessary alongside onChange to control inputs)
a button that will call the function on click to generate an icon accordingly once 
it has read all values of all the inputs 

//Functionality for Grabbing Api info:
an empty initial state that will equal the values of the different types of grabbable relevant data
this variable will also equal the base string used to fetch data that will be modified based on user inputs

//Functionality for grabbing and reading user inputs:
an empty initial state that will equal all relevant user inputs 
once set to those values, those values will be parsed into the url 

//Logic for grabbing info from the url & replacing parts of it with values of inputs:
String interpolation for the url 
Assign variables to equal the values of different inputs
Put in those variables in the proper positions of the url

//Plan for the structure of the storage of changeable data
Store all the possible variants of each characterisitic of the avatar 
in seperate js files.
Import them into the App js file 
Map them out with array methods
